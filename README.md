# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## My Journey and development

Building the Code_Quiz with multiple-choice question; which is a app that runs in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Concept of the design and function

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN the button turns red and the word incorrect flashes up in the left hand corner. No points are gain with incorrect answers.
WHEN I answer a question correctly
THEN the button turns green.The word correct flashes up in the left hand corner. Points are gained with correct answers.
WHEN all questions are completed
THEN Game is over.
THEN I can save my scores and play again
```
