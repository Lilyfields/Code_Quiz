# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## My Journey and development

Building the Code_Quiz with multiple-choice question; which is a app that runs in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Concept of the design and function

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## My Final Outcome

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
